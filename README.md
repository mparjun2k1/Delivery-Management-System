# Delivery-Management-System
This Go project is a delivery management system implemented as a web server that uses an idiomatic modular structure to organize its components. The project root contains the main entry point main.go, which sets up HTTP routes mapping to handlers defined in internal packages user and order. The internal/user package manages user-related operations such as registration and login with handlers like RegisterHandler and LoginHandler, while the internal/order package includes order-related logic such as placing orders and tracking status through handlers like OrderHandler and TrackHandler. Each handler handles HTTP requests with method checks and writes appropriate HTTP responses, while logging activity to the server console. The project uses Go modules for dependency management, allowing easy builds and execution via go run main.go from the project root, where logs and server status are visible. This structure promotes code clarity, modularity, and scalability suitable for a real-world web application that can be expanded with database integration, authentication, and frontend interaction.
